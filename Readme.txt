Notes
-----

This build has been tested to compile correctly using VS2013, but should also compile with MonoDevelop or
SharpDevelop.
Joystick hat support does not function correctly in the current release build of OpenTK (1.1.4)- Please
compile OpenTK yourself from the most recent source if you wish to use this feature.
